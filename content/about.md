The HITar is an AI-powered augmented guitar that enables performers to play virtual drums and percussion by hitting the body of the instrument.

Our AI engine captures the expressiveness of each body hit:
no two hits sound the same, just like on acoustic percussion.
The HITar supports virtual instruments based on physical models or sample libraries, so that every performer can find their voice.
