## HITar wins Third Place at the 2023 Guthman Musical Instrument Competition

The HITar participated at the [2023 Guthman Musical Instrument competition](https://guthman.gatech.edu/2023-competition),
a worldwide competition of novel musical interfaces hosted by GeorgiaTech in
Atlanta, GA on March 10th and 11th 2023.

Andrea presented the HITar working with CNRS-AMU PRISM MetaSynth, a perceptually
inspired modal synthesis engine that imitates virtual bodies of any material,
shape and size. The properties of the virtual body were modified in real time
by the HITar's AI engine.

The HItar got third place at the competition, and Andrea played a set with the
HITar accompanied by local virtuoso guitar player Nat Condit-Schultz.
