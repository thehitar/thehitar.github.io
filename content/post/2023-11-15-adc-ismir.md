## The HITar's technology presented at ISMIR 2023 and Audio Developers Conference 2023

No rest for the wicked! The HITar's technology got presented
at two important conferences for music technology in November 2023.
First off was ISMIR on 5th-9th November, right in Milan, the birthplace of HITar founder Andrea.
We had a great time presenting our work, but even better,
Andrea played his composition "Sliogan" to the ISMIR audience during the music
track. THe performance ended in a standing ovation!

Then a flight back to London brought us to the Audio Developer Conference (ADC)
on 13th-15th November. Here, Andrea and fellow AIM PhD student Franco Caspe
gave the talk "Deep Learning for DSP Engineers: challenges and tricks to be
productive with real-time AI in audio". The HITar project was used as a case
study to break down the main technical challenges in developing a deep learning
system on a real-time musical interface from the ground up.
