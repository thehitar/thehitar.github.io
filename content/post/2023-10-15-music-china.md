## HITar exhibits at Music China 2023

As a MIDI Innovation Awards winner, the HITar was displayed at
Music China 2023 in Shanghai, for the full four days from
11th to 14th October.

The experience was incredible. We give everyone who stopped by
a heartfelt thanks, and we are so grateful to have had such
meaningful and positive contacts. We really hope we will be back
next year!
