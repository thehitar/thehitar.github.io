## Come see the HItar at NAMM 2024!

The last great opportunity from our win of the 2023 MIDI Innovation Awards
is a flight to Anaheim, California to the Mecca of musical instruments.
The epicentre of sonic epicness. Where all good things music start.
The NAMM show!!! And we took it.

Come see us throughout the four days of the show from 25th until the 28th January
at booth #10302, the MIDI Association Booth, alongside the great AR instrument Netz by
fellow AIM PhD student and creator Max Graf. On Saturday 27th, the MIDI Innovation
Awards Winners will have a presentation starting at 11:30.

### Here are the details of the event:
